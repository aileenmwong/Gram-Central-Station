# Gram Central Station ###

Gram Central Station is the place where Instagram lovers can save their future gram-ventures. In addition to saving photos for reference, users can also add comments and add a status to indicate whteher or not they've done it. In addition, they can also use the search feature to look for spots nearby to potentially find a new hidden gem.

As a heavy social media user, my friends and I are often sending each other photos of things or places we want to go to. The problem is that when we actually have time to go to them, we forget and always go back to our old haunts. We've started to share cloud based docs that we add to every time we find something new, but ultimately the doc gets forgotten and it's too late because the exhibit has closed or the store is sold out.
